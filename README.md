# MLL-hybrid-model

This code has been written in the context of a master thesis. It makes use of the PHIsim software (written by E. Bente et al. from Eindhoven University of Technology), which can be found here:

Note that both the PHIsim_inputv3 and PHIsim_v3 files should be installed in order to use the code in this repository. These should be added to the path such that they can be easily invoked by the program. The file main.py contains an example of a specific simulation set-up.
