# MLL-hybrid-model

This code has been written in the context of a master thesis. It makes use of the PHIsim software (written by E. Bente et al. from Eindhoven University of Technology), which can be found here:
https://sites.google.com/tue.nl/phisim/home/installation

Note that both the PHIsim_inputv3 and PHIsim_v3 files should be installed in order to use the code in this repository. These should be added to the path such that they can be easily invoked by the program. Since this software relies on a slightly different version of PHIsim, unexpected errors might occur.

The file main.py contains an example of a specific simulation set-up.

Based on a paper by Stijn Cuyvers et al.
